# Overall ToB Timer

If you find any errors or know how to improve this plugin, feel free to add/message me on discord:

I won't check GitHub for any pull/push requests, so always contact me via discord for anything regarding that.

Feel free to use this code however you want. I don't care if you straight up rip code from this to make something better.

This plugin displays a realtime timer overlay which displays the raid's current overall time in mm:ss.SS format.

The timer begins as soon as the player enters Maiden's room.

The timer will freeze and turn a green color when the raid is finished.
    The raid ending is determined by p3 Verzik's bat form despawning.

When the player enters the tob lobby, determined by checking regionIDs, the timer overlay disappears and resets for the next run.

The timer counts up in intervals of 0.6s because why not?

Entry mode was implemented because it was faster to debug. I chose to just leave it in because again, why not?

There are 2 limitations I don't really like and will probably fix in the future:
    The timer only begins when the local player enters Maiden's room, not when ANY player does.
    This timer does not display any splits via overlay, text file, or side menu.

Honestly, this plugin is ridiculously niche, but it might be a nice motivator for some players to get in the habit of going faster. 

I wanted this plugin because I like overall time per raid, but I don't believe anyone has ever made a plugin for this.

The only ACTUAL use case I can see is when people are potting specifically for a overall raid time, but this isn't common.
